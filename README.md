# Watch Youtube Shorts as normal videos

A very simple userscript to open any Youtube Short video as if it was a normal video.
(e.g. comment section, horizontal orientation, etc.)

## Installation

* Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey addon to your Firefox or Chrome (ask google for instructions for other browsers)
* Just click [this link](https://github.com/makise-homura/watch-youtube-shorts-as-normal-videos/raw/master/watch-youtube-shorts-as-normal-videos.user.js), it will install user script to your Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey.
* Now, if you click any link to video from Youtube Shorts, you will be automatically redirected to the same video, but viewed as normal one.
* You may configure things like auto-update and other stuff in your Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey menu.
